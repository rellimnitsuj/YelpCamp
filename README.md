# YelpCamp (Work In Progress)
My take on Colt Steele's renowned YelpCamp!

Think of Yelp, but for campsites! You first create an account, then you can add/edit/delete your posted campgrounds, leave a review on other people's posted campgrounds, etc.

This is the main project of Colt Steele's online Web Development Bootcamp. This online bootcamp is a complete full-stack developer course that covers a wide range of topics such as: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, etc.

I will be creating this program from scratch by following along with Colt's videos and I will be continually updating this repo until the program is complete. I also plan on making a few changes here and there from Colt's original YelpCamp to make it personalized.
